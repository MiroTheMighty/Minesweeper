<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. The game is played by revealing cells on the board, with each cell either containing a mine or a number indicating the count of adjacent mines.

This project aims to provide a simple implementation of the Minesweeper game using C++ and SFML.
